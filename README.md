# This is an executable port of the classic Connect 4 game. One phone will serve as host and receive commands from the other during gameplay. Also, we update the visual model of the game and offerÂ the opportunity to play by yourself against a computer.
# There is a presentation detailing the project's design that can be used as a guide for constructing the code.
